    sportsStory: "From childhood, I was actively involved in sports and passionate about various disciplines. Football particularly captured my interest at age 5 when I received a ball as a birthday gift — from that moment, the sport became a true passion of mine. I took my first step toward professional development in second grade when I started training with the local village team. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when our coach passed away during the second training session, temporarily halting my sporting activities. After a few months' break, my father took me to one of the teams in a nearby city. However, there was no age-appropriate group available, and my physical development at the time wasn't sufficient to compete with players two years older. Eventually, following my mother's persistent advice, I focused my attention on mathematics — thus ending my pursuit of a sporting career, though my love for football remains to this day",
