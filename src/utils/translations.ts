    sportsStory: "I have been active since childhood and was passionate about various sports. Football particularly caught my attention at age 5, when I was given a football as a birthday gift — since then, this sport became a true passion for me. I took my first step on the professional path in second grade, when I started training with the local village team. Unfortunately, a tragic incident occurred — my coach passed away on the day of the second training session. After a few months' break, I decided to try my luck again. My father took me to one of the teams in a nearby city, but unfortunately for me (or perhaps fortunately), there was no age group for my age there, and my physical attributes were still unsuitable for playing with players two years older at that time. Finally, after all this, at my mother's insistence, I followed mathematics — thus ended my aspiration toward a professional football career.\n\n2019–2020 📍 Komarovi Volleyball Team\n2020–2022 ⚽️ Komarovi Football Team\n2022–2023 🏐 KIU Volleyball Team\n2024–2025 ⚽️ KIU Football Team",
